How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	Viewing the text side by side
	with the flags in the margin made it very easy to 
	find and locate changes in the files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Just the ability to isolate a buggy version and compare it to the last
    working verison with the above feature with speed up debugging greatly

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    First Pro that comes to mind is just economy of space. How many versions would 
    we create if we were auto saving?
    First Con: I suppose going too long between commits has it's own set of complications

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    A developer making changes to 1 file may affect several other files at the same time
    and example being how an HTML file may affect an attached CSS file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log  will show list of commits
    git diff will compare 2 commits for differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Well, it offers an undo option- albeit a somewhat complicated one. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I look forward to getting comfortable using git for debugging
    as well as creating branches for experimentation.
