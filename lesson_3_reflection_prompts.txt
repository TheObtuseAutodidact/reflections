When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    The first thing that comes to mind here is again working with 1 or more
    other devs on a project. If one is sharing a project and working on the same
    piece as another dev, git automatically pulling new updates may move the goal post on 
    what one dev is working on based on the remote update of another. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    a clone is a full copy of a git repository pulled from github onto local machine or 
    copied from one location on a local machine to another location on that same machine.
    a fork is a copy from a github repo to a new github repo
    a branch a locally made copy of a repo effectively allowing for the creation of a new 
    or experimental version

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If a dev is going to be working offline for a period of time, having the last know state
    of of a remote lets him/her either work from that point or compare what he/she has done
    with referece to the most recently submitted work by another/others. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without github I suppose most colaboration would occure via email. 
    This might offer the parties communicating the option to be vary specific
    but the lack of standardization might create confusion. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Experimental features are the first things that come to mind here. 
    Creating a new branch would allow for experimentation while protecting a production/public branch.
