When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    The first thing that comes to mind here is again working with 1 or more
    other devs on a project. If one is sharing a project and working on the same
    piece as another dev, git automatically pulling new updates may move the goal post on 
    what one dev is working on based on the remote update of another. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    a clone is a full copy of a git repository pulled from github onto local machine or 
    copied from one location on a local machine to another location on that same machine.
    a fork is a copy from a github repo to a new github repo
    a branch a locally made copy of a repo effectively allowing for the creation of a new 
    or experimental version

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
