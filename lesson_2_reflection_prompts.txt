What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git creates a hidden directory to track targeted files or directory in your chosen directory.
	You must initialize git before you can make commits.  

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area seems to be a palate of sorts to set up the changes you think 
	you want to make and then check them before committing them. 
	This seems a simple safely feature.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	The staging area will allow the user to review individual changes and to commit 
	each individually 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	Branches would be helpful in working out new ideas for a given program, refactoring 
	a program, or hammering on problems wherein the solution isn't clear. 
	Branches would offer a safe place to play/problem solve where if one found
	one like a solution or feature, that feature could be selectively merged with the master branch

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	It's easy to see parent/child relationships via the diagrams 
	addtionally, it's also helpful to see development of various branches
	and get an idea of the projects overall progress.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
	The result is an new branch that keeps the name of the checked out branch but contains the 
	elements of both branches. We diagram this as such because it brings the two branches together 
	creating a new one. 


What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
	Auto merging is easier and if one has created a branch as a simple scratch pad
	and then achieved something that would simply be added back into the master branch,
	auto merging is convenient. 
	Maunually merging files is safer. 1 or more developers will deliberate on which
	changes belong to the master branch.
